# Basic Online Pokemon Game

 - Original by ByteCampio at https://github.com/bytecampio/pokemon
 - Changes made by thenerdoflight of jadestudios.uk

**Navigating the folders**

 - str_poke contains all the HTML/CSS/JS that runs the game
 - str_images contains all the image files used by the game
	 - bg.jpg is used by index.html
 - index.html is for the page that holds the game

This means that the pokemon.html in the str_poke can be ran. However, ***this version is optimized for w=789 and h=762.***
